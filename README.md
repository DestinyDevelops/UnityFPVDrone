# Unity FPV Drone Simulation.
Unity FPV Drone Simulation is a very simple FPV (First Person View) drone controller created in unity. The project comes with a simple dev scene with a working drone with some base values set, and as a bonus, there is also a simple lighting system with a beautiful ocean.

This project was made in Unity version 6000.0.17f1 for the High Definition Render Pipeline.
The scripts can be found in the Scripts folder and extracted into your project if needed.
